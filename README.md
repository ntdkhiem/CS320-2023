Many instructors provide online-forum-based support for their courses. For large classes, things can get unwieldy: lots of students, lots of posts, lots of people monitoring the forums at once.<br>
The goal of this project is to provide a dashboard for instructors or course staff to get a "forum weather report" (traffic level, unanswered questions, participation levels from students and staff, etc.)<br></br>

Desiderata:
- Current state of the forum assessments (e.g., traffic rates, number of unanswered posts, current response times)
- Participation reporting indicating engagement levels for staff members (forum visits, posts answered, etc.)
- Student engagement reporting indicating how many students are posting or commenting, which students are most active, etc.
- Reporting on trending topics or categories found in posts or comments
